# ☁️ My Cloud

A lightweight, self-hosted file sharing platform in the spirit of **Nextcloud / ownCloud** — but with **zero database setup**. Built for Unraid and other home servers, aimed at people who don't have a ton of files and don't want to babysit MySQL or Postgres.

Everything is stored as plain files:

- **Your files** stay as ordinary files on disk (`/data/users/<username>/files`) — browse them with any other tool, back them up with rsync, nothing is locked inside a database blob.
- **App state** (users, share links, settings) is a handful of small JSON files in `/config`.

## Features

- 🔐 **Multi-user accounts** — admin-managed users with bcrypt-hashed passwords, per-user storage quotas, and isolated home folders
- 📁 **Fast web file browser** — grid & list views, breadcrumbs, multi-select (Ctrl/Shift-click), rename, move, copy, new folders
- ⬆️ **Drag & drop uploads** — multiple files and whole folders, with a live progress bar; quota enforced server-side
- 👁 **Previews** — images, video and audio (with seeking), PDFs, and text/code files
- ✏️ **Built-in text editor** — edit notes, configs, and markdown right in the browser
- 🔗 **Public share links** — share any file or folder with a link; optional password, optional expiry, and optional "drop box" mode letting visitors upload into a shared folder
- 🗑 **Trash bin** — deletes go to trash first, with restore and configurable auto-purge
- 🔍 **Search** — instant filename search across your whole home folder
- 📦 **Zip downloads** — download any folder or multi-selection as a zip, streamed on the fly
- 🖼️ **Thumbnails** — fast server-generated, disk-cached image thumbnails so photo folders load instantly
- 🔌 **WebDAV** — mount your files as a network drive in Finder, Windows Explorer, mobile apps, or rclone (`/dav/`, sign in with your account)
- 📱 **Responsive UI + installable PWA** — works nicely on phones with automatic light/dark theme, and installs as an app ("Add to Home Screen")
- 🧳 **First-run setup** — open the web UI once and create your admin account; that's it

## Quick start (Unraid)

1. Copy `templates/my-cloud.xml` into `/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/` — save it as `my-My-Cloud.xml` (Unraid strips the `my-` filename prefix to label user templates in the Add Container dropdown). Or install from Community Applications once published.

   ```bash
   wget -O /boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/my-My-Cloud.xml \
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evilgenius79/My-Cloud/main/templates/my-cloud.xml
   ```
2. Map:
   - **`/config`** → `/mnt/user/appdata/my-cloud` (settings, users, shares)
   - **`/data`** → `/mnt/user/my-cloud` (where user files live)
   - **Port** `8686` → any free host port
3. Start the container, open `http://your-server:8686`, and create the first admin account.

## Quick start (Docker / docker-compose)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evilgenius79/My-Cloud.git
cd My-Cloud
docker compose up -d --build
# open http://localhost:8686
```

## Quick start (bare Node.js)

Requires Node 18+.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # stores state in ./dev-config and ./dev-data
# open http://localhost:8686
```

## Configuration

| Environment variable  | Default   | Purpose                                  |
| Environment variable         | Default   | Purpose                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MYCLOUD_CONFIG_DIR`         | `/config` | Settings, users, shares, session secret                        |
| `MYCLOUD_DATA_DIR`           | `/data`   | User files (`users/<name>/files`)                              |
| `MYCLOUD_PORT`               | `8686`    | HTTP port                                                      |
| `PUID` / `PGID`              | `99`/`100`| User/group that owns created files (Unraid `nobody:users`)     |
| `UMASK`                      | `022`     | Permission mask for created files                              |
| `MYCLOUD_TRUST_PROXY`        | private   | Which proxies to trust for client IP. Defaults to loopback/private ranges; set to a hop count (e.g. `1`) only if you know your proxy chain. **Never set to `true` on an internet-exposed install** — it lets clients spoof their IP and defeat the login rate-limiter. |
| `MYCLOUD_FORCE_SECURE_COOKIE`| off       | Set to `1` to force the `Secure` cookie flag when TLS is terminated at a proxy that doesn't send `X-Forwarded-Proto`. |

The container runs as a non-root user (`PUID:PGID`) and fixes ownership of `/config` and `/data` on first start. Runtime settings (site name, default quota, trash retention) are editable from the **Admin** page in the UI.

## How data is laid out

```
/config
  settings.json       # site settings
  users.json          # accounts (passwords bcrypt-hashed)
  shares.json         # public share links
  secret.key          # session-signing secret (keep private)

/data
  users/
    alice/
      files/          # alice's files — plain files, nothing special
      trash/          # deleted items + small .meta.json sidecars
```

Backing up My Cloud = backing up those two folders. Restoring = putting them back. There is no database to dump, migrate, or repair.

## Security notes

- Passwords are stored bcrypt-hashed; sessions are HMAC-signed `HttpOnly` cookies, revoked on password change.
- Login attempts are rate-limited per IP **and per username** (so an IP-rotating spray against one account is still throttled); the whole public share surface is rate-limited too.
- All file paths are validated server-side against directory traversal, and download paths reject symlinks that resolve outside your area.
- Storage quotas are enforced on uploads (including anonymous drop-box shares), copies, and restores; trash counts toward quota.
- Uploaded HTML/SVG is served sandboxed (`Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`) so it can't script against the app.
- The container runs as a non-root user; images are published with build provenance and an SBOM.
- **Use HTTPS** if you expose this to the internet — put it behind a reverse proxy (Nginx Proxy Manager, SWAG, Traefik, Caddy) with a TLS certificate, and make sure it forwards `X-Forwarded-Proto` (or set `MYCLOUD_FORCE_SECURE_COOKIE=1`). Cookies are `SameSite=Lax`/`HttpOnly` but only as safe as the transport.

## Roadmap ideas

- WebDAV endpoint for desktop sync clients
- Server-generated thumbnails for large photo folders
- Share links for multiple selections
- Activity log

PRs welcome.
